[WIP] lower level CV algorithms (potentially implemented with `-betterC`), with optional C API headers

Idea would be for DCV to be relying on mir-cv as dependency, providing higher level API for those lower level algorithms. See for eg #3 as first step towards that (see https://github.com/libmir/mir-cv/issues/4#issuecomment-367427761)

But still unsure whether this separation is needed.
